Minimum width calculation (use the *)
%.2f (2 decimal points)
%.*f (choose from the results)

%.*d (find from the input or results)

these are classes, not functions!
int()
str()

Everything in Python is a class.
Range is a class of it's own in Python 3, but is a function in Python 2.

Eval() and repr() are inverts of each other
