Note that this is a faulty function for swapping occurrences of
'orange' for 'apple' and occurrences of 'apple' for 'orange' in the
text.  It is faulty because it is case-sensitive and because it would
change"category" to "dogegory".  You don't care for this exercise.
We'll get it right when we do regular expressions.
