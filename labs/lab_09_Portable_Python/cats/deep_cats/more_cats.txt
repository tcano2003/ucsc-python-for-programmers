In my house we have 3 cats who love to tease our old dog.  The old dog
gets quite bewildered when they take turns running in front of him and
getting in his way.  He steps around one cat, then the next cat, then
the next cat, just to find the first cat again in his way.  However,
at nap time, they all curl up together, 3 cats and one old dog.
